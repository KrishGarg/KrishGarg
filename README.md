# Hi there, I'm Krish Garg  👋

## I am a learning programmer and a fresher at BITS Goa (CS).
- 📖 Finished JEE with 21** in advance, now will explore myself at college.
- 😁 I like to create open-source projects so that I can help others in the same field.
- 🤖 I was working on a multi-purpose discord bot but after the closing of discord.py, I got discouraged and stopped the project.
- 🥅 My goal: To become a good all-rounder.
- 👨‍🏭 Fun Fact: I used to play the violin before someone ate a bat.
